# ♟️ Chess — A Terminal-Based OOP Chess Game in Python

This is a **fully playable chess game** built with **Object-Oriented Programming in Python**, designed to be run directly in your terminal with a simple and intuitive interface.

> ✅ The goal of this project was to learn Python by building a real game using minimal external libraries.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-chess-repo.git
   cd your-chess-repo

## 🎮 How to Play
When prompted, select the position of the piece you want to move.
Your selected square will be highlighted in blue.

Then select the target square where you want to move your piece.

All standard chess rules are enforced: legal moves, check, checkmate, captures, and turn-taking.

The game runs fully in the terminal, thanks to the rich library for rendering the board.

 ## 📦 Project Goals
✅ Build a functional chess game with minimal dependencies

✅ Focus on object-oriented design in Python

✅ Get hands-on experience working with:

· Class inheritance

· Method overriding

· Static and abstract methods

· Enum usage

· Game loop logic

## 🛠 Built With
Python — Core logic and OOP structure

rich — Beautiful terminal rendering (used for the chess board)

## 💡 Future Improvements
Save/load game state

Add AI opponent

Add PGN export

Highlight checks, pins, and forks

Add move history log
